    "#### Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Yes, it is permissible to import the same module multiple times using separate import statements. This can serve different purposes, such as renaming the module, selectively importing specific components, creating separate namespaces, or modifying module-level configuration. By importing the same module multiple times, you can achieve better code readability, reduce potential naming conflicts, isolate module components, and customize module behavior in different parts of the code."

    "#### Q2. What are some of a module's characteristics? (Name at least one.)\n",
    "**Ans:** Modules in Python are files that encapsulate related code and data. They promote code reusability, code organization, and modularity. Modules have their own namespace, allowing for encapsulation and avoiding naming conflicts. They can be imported in other modules or scripts, facilitating code reuse. Modules provide scope for variables, functions, and classes defined within them. They enable the separation of concerns and promote a modular programming approach. Modules encapsulate data and provide data abstraction. Overall, modules enhance code organization, maintainability, and reusability in Python programs."

    "#### Q3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "**Ans:** Circular importing means importing the two modules in each other. If suppose we are wokring in `MOD1.py` file and it is importing some function say F2() from some other module say\n",
    "`MOD2.PY` file or we can do vice-versa. What will happen is: This will give an `import error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because when we import F2() function from module `MOD2.py`, then this will execute `MOD2.py` file. And in `MOD2.py` file there is an another statement of importing `MOD1.py` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will result in endless loop. To avoid this error just do one thingWe can use if `__name__ == '__main__'`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function, you can't directly refer to the function in the program. The addition of this sentence avoids the endless loop of the program ."

    "#### Q4. Why is  **`__all__`** in Python ?\n",
    "**Ans:** The `__all__` variable in Python is used to specify the public interface of a module. It is an optional attribute that allows module developers to control what gets imported when another module uses the from module import * syntax. By defining `__all__`, developers can explicitly list the names intended to be part of the module's public interface. This provides clarity, helps prevent naming conflicts, and improves code readability. "

    "#### Q5. In what situation is it useful to refer to the `__name__` attribute or the string `__main_ _` ?\n",
    "**Ans:** The `__name__` attribute and the string `__main__` in Python are used to differentiate between the execution of a script and the import of a module. The `__name__` attribute is set to '__main__' when a script is run directly, allowing for the inclusion of code blocks that should only be executed in this context. When a module is imported, the `__name__` attribute is set to the name of the module itself. This feature is useful for module initialization, testing, debugging, and creating modular code structures. By utilizing `__name__` and `__main__`, developers can control the behavior of their code based on how it is being executed."
