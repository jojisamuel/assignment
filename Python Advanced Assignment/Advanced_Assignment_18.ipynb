    "#### Q1. Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph.\n",
    "**Ans:** Text files store data as human-readable characters using a specific character encoding, while binary files store data in a binary format that is not directly human-readable. Text files are editable with text editors and are commonly used for plain text data, while binary files store various types of data and require specialized tools for manipulation"

    "#### Q2. What are some scenarios where using text files will be the better option? When would you like to use binary files instead of text files?\n",
    "**Ans:** Text files are suitable for human-readable and editable data, while binary files are preferred for storing complex data structures, achieving better performance, or preserving data integrity in non-textual formats. The choice between text and binary files depends on the nature of the data, its intended use, and the requirements of the specific application or scenario."

    "#### Q3. What are some of the issues with using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disc?\n",
    "**Ans:** Using binary operations to read and write Python integers directly to disk can lead to issues such as platform dependence, lack of portability, data interpretation challenges, limited flexibility, and reduced readability."

    "#### Q4. Describe a benefit of using the with keyword instead of explicitly opening a file ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Using the with keyword in Python for file handling provides the benefit of automatic resource management. It ensures that files are properly closed, even in the presence of exceptions, preventing resource leaks. The with statement also improves code readability by clearly defining the scope of file operations and simplifies the code by eliminating the need to manually call the close() method."

    "#### Q5. Does Python have the trailing newline while reading a line of text? Does Python append a newline when you write a line of text?\n",
    "**Ans:** When reading a line of text in Python, the trailing newline character is preserved. Python does not automatically remove the newline character from the end of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a line of text, Python does not automatically append a newline character. You need to explicitly include the newline character ('\\n') if you want to add it at the end of the line."

    "#### Q7. When do you think you'll use the struct package the most?\n",
    "**Ans:** The struct package in Python is useful for working with binary data. It provides functions for packing and unpacking binary data according to specified formats. This package is commonly used for tasks such as parsing binary data, serializing and deserializing data structures, interfacing with low-level systems, and network programming."

    "#### Q8. When is pickling the best option?\n",
    "**Ans:** Pickling in Python is a serialization technique that allows you to store and retrieve Python objects in a binary format. It is commonly used for object persistence, interprocess communication, caching, distributed computing, and deep copying. Pickling provides a convenient way to serialize and deserialize complex objects, enabling data storage, transfer, and manipulation."

    "#### Q9. When will it be best to use the shelve package?\n",
    "**Ans:** The shelve package in Python is a good choice when we need a simple way to store and retrieve Python objects persistently using key-value pairs."

   "source": [
    "#### Q10. What is a special restriction when using the shelve package, as opposed to using other data dictionaries?\n",
    "**Ans:** The shelve package in Python has a special restriction where the keys used to store data must be strings. This means that non-string keys need to be converted to strings before storing them in a shelve object"
