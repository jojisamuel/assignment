    "#### Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "**Ans:** Classes in python act as a blueprint based on which objects are created. Objects are the very basis for object-oriented programming. The objects are the real-world entities, and class acts as a template that defines those objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in Python are files with a .py extension using which we can reuse elements inside that file. When we create a python program, the program may contain inside it functions, variables, and even classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, classes and modules are related in that classes can be defined within a module, and modules can be used to group related classes and provide a namespace for them."

    "**Ans:** In Python, the term \"self\" is a convention used within a class to refer to the instance of the class itself. It is the first parameter of class methods and instance methods.The \"self\" parameter allows you to access and manipulate the instance attributes and methods of the class. It is automatically passed when you call a method on an instance of the class. Using \"self\" helps differentiate between instance attributes and local variables within a method."

    "#### Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "**Ans:** In Python, operator overloading allows you to define the behavior of built-in operators such as +, -, *, /, and many others for objects of a custom class. By overloading operators, you can specify how instances of your class should behave when operated with these operators.\n",
    "To overload an operator in a Python class, you need to define special methods with predefined names. These methods are called \"magic\" or \"dunder\" (double underscore) methods. They are special because they start and end with double underscores.\n",

    "    __add__(self, other): Overloads the + operator.\n",

    "    __mul__(self, other): Overloads the * operator.\n",
    "    __div__(self, other): Overloads the / operator.\n",
    "    __eq__(self, other): Overloads the == operator for equality comparison.\n",

    "**Ans:** Operator overloading in classes should be considered when it enhances the readability, expressiveness, and intuitiveness of your code. It is beneficial when there is a clear conceptual mapping between the operators and the behavior you want to define for your class. It simplifies code, improves readability, and aligns with familiar syntax and conventions."

    "#### Q8. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?\n",
    "**Ans:** The most popular form of operator overloading in Python is the overloading of arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, and /. This allows objects of a custom class to participate in arithmetic operations as if they were built-in numeric types. Overloading these operators is commonly used when working with classes representing mathematical concepts or objects that can be manipulated using arithmetic operations."
