    "#### Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "**Ans:** Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple parent classes. In other words, a class can inherit from more than one superclass, acquiring the characteristics of all those superclasses."

    "#### Q2. What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "**Ans:** Delegation in object-oriented programming is the practice of one object (delegate) assigning a specific task to another object (delegatee). Instead of directly implementing the task, the delegating object forwards the responsibility to the delegatee object, which is responsible for carrying out the task. Delegation promotes code reuse, modularity, and flexible class designs by allowing objects to collaborate and divide responsibilities. It is a way to achieve composition over inheritance and enables objects to rely on the behavior of other objects without being tightly coupled to their implementation."

    "#### Q3. What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "**Ans:** Composition, in object-oriented programming, refers to the practice of constructing complex objects by assembling or composing simpler objects. It involves creating instances of other classes as components or attributes within a class, establishing a \"has-a\" relationship between the containing object and the contained objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition enables code reuse, modularity, and flexibility in software design by breaking down complex functionalities into smaller, reusable components. Rather than relying on inheritance, composition allows objects to collaborate by combining their capabilities through composition relationships."

    "#### Q4. What are bound methods and how do we use them?\n",
    "**Ans:** Bound methods in Python are methods that are associated with an instance of a class. They are used to access and manipulate the specific data of an instance. When a bound method is called on an instance, the instance is automatically passed as the first argument, commonly referred to as self.\n",

    "#### Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "**Ans:** Pseudoprivate attributes in Python serve the purpose of providing a degree of encapsulation by making class attributes less accessible from outside the class. These attributes are identified by using a double underscore prefix `(__)` before their names.\n",
    "The primary objective of pseudoprivate attributes is to discourage accidental access or modification from external code. By utilizing the double underscore prefix, it signals to other developers that the attribute is intended for internal use within the class and should not be directly accessed."
