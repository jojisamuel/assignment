    "#### Q1. Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results at the runtime ?\n",
    "**Ans:** The assignment operator += in Python is not just for show; The += operator is used for in-place addition, which means it modifies the value of the variable in place rather than creating a new object. In the case of mutable objects like lists, it can offer performance benefits because it avoids the overhead of creating a new object and assigning it back to the variable."

    "**Ans:** In most programming languages, you would need at least three statements to replace the Python expression a, b = a + b, a. This is because most programming languages do not support the multiple assignment feature present in Python, where multiple variables can be assigned values in a single line"

    "**Ans:** In Python, functions are considered \"first-class objects,\" which means they have the same capabilities as any other object in the language. This distinction allows functions in Python to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, stored in data structures, and used as elements of other objects. These features provide flexibility, dynamic behavior, and expressive programming possibilities that are not typically available in languages like C or C++"

It is defined using the @decorator_name syntax and automatically applies the decorator to the decorated function or class. Decorators provide a concise and convenient way to apply wrappers in Python."

    "#### Q10. If a function is a generator function, what does it return?\n",
    "**Ans:** A generator function in Python returns a generator object. The generator object can be used to iterate over a sequence of values one at a time. The generator function's code is executed only when values are requested, and it uses the `yield` statement to produce each value. The generator object behaves as an iterator, allowing values to be retrieved using `for` loops or the `next()` function. Generators provide a convenient way to create sequences of values without storing them in memory all at once."

    "**Ans:** To transform a regular function into a generator function in Python, the only necessary change is to replace the return statement with yield statements. The yield statement suspends the function's execution and returns a value each time it is encountered, preserving the function's state to resume from where it left off. "

    "#### Q12. Identify at least one benefit of generators.\n",
    "**Ans:** One benefit of generators in Python is their memory efficiency. Instead of allocating memory for the entire sequence upfront, generators only keep track of the current state and generate the next value as needed. This makes generators particularly useful when working with large or dynamically generated data, as they can generate values on-demand without requiring excessive memory resources."
