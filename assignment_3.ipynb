    "      • Avoid repetition of codes.\n",
    "      • Increases program readability.\n",
    "      • Divide a complex problem into simpler ones.\n",

    "**Ans:** There's only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten.  \n",
    " Local scopes are created at function call, not at function definition, so we can have as many different local scopes as function calls.\n",

    "**Ans:** A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result to the caller code.  \n",
