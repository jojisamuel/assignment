    "#### 1. To what does a relative path refer ?\n",
    "**Ans:**  Relative path means the path of a certain file relative to the current working directory.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For example, if the current working directory is C:\\PythonProjects\\Tutorials, the path.py file’s relative path would be \\Paths\\paths.py which is shorter and easier to use than the absolute path C:\\PythonProjects\\Tutorials\\Paths\\paths.py.\n",

    "**Ans:** `os.getcwd()` method tells us the location of current working directory (CWD) whereas `os.chdir()` method in Python used to change the current working directory to specified path. These functions are similar to linux commands `pwd` and `cd`"

    "**Ans:** A file can be Accessed in python using `open()` function. open function takes two arguments filename and mode of operation (optional). if mode is not provided the default mode of opening is read mode   \n",
    "So, the syntax being: **`open(filename, mode)`**\n",

    "* **`'r+'`** – Read/Write Mode: Use this mode if you need to simultaneously read and write to a file.\n",
    "* **`'w'`** – Write Mode: Using this mode will overwrite any existing content in a file. If the given file does not exist, a new one will be created. \n",
    "* **`'a'`** – Append Mode: With this mode the user can append the data without overwriting any already existing data in the file. \n",
    "* **`'a+'`** – Append and Read Mode: In this mode you can read and append the data without overwriting the original file.\n",
    "* **`'x'`** – Exclusive Creating Mode: This mode is for the sole purpose of creating new files. Use this mode if you know the file to be written doesn’t exist beforehand."
