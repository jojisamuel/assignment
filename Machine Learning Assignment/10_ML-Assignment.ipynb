    "**Ans:** The Bayesian interpretation of probability is a framework that views probability as a measure of belief or uncertainty in the occurrence of an event. Unlike the frequentist interpretation, which relies on long-run frequencies, Bayesian probability incorporates prior knowledge and updates beliefs based on new evidence. The key components include:\n",
