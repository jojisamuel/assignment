    "**Ans:** Data investigation is crucial for understanding patterns, detecting outliers, ensuring data quality, and informing modeling decisions. Qualitative data exploration focuses on categorical attributes, utilizing techniques like frequency counts and bar charts to understand category distribution. Quantitative data exploration, dealing with numeric attributes, employs histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to analyze distribution characteristics, central tendency, and relationships. Despite differences in focus, both types benefit from summary statistics and visualizations for comprehensive analysis. The primary goal is to gain insights into the data's characteristics and guide subsequent analytical and modeling steps"

The process involves organizing data into a contingency table, examining the frequency distribution of each variable, creating a cross-tabulation table, and analyzing patterns. The conversion of counts into percentages or proportions allows for easier comparison, and the optional use of a chi-square test helps assess the significance of the relationship. Visualization and interpretation of the cross-tabulation results provide insights into the associations between the variables. "
