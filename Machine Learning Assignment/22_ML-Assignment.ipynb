    "**Ans:** Ensemble methods, such as voting, can be employed to combine predictions from multiple models to enhance overall performance. In the context of a classification problem, both hard and soft voting strategies can be utilized. Hard voting involves a majority vote among individual models, while soft voting considers the average probabilities assigned by each model. Implementation can be achieved using scikit-learn's VotingClassifier. This approach is particularly beneficial when the models exhibit diverse strengths and weaknesses."

    "**Ans:** Ensemble methods, such as bagging (e.g., Random Forests) and pasting, can benefit from distributed training across multiple servers, speeding up the process by training models independently on different subsets of data. Boosting ensembles, which build models sequentially, may pose challenges for distributed training due to their sequential nature. Stacking ensembles involve training diverse models, and while the training of individual models can be distributed, the final combination may require central coordination. The choice of distributed computing frameworks and communication mechanisms between servers plays a crucial role in the ease of implementation. Overall, distributed training is more straightforward for bagging and pasting ensembles compared to boosting and stacking ensembles."

    "**Ans:**  Extra-Trees introduce extra randomness by using random thresholds for all features at each split, leading to increased diversity among trees. This can result in better generalization and improved robustness to noise. The computational efficiency of Extra-Trees is often an advantage, making them faster to train compared to traditional Random Forests."
