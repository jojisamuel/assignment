    "**Ans:** Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from a labeled dataset, consisting of input-output pairs. The algorithm is trained to predict output labels based on input data, adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and true labels. The significance of the name \"supervised learning\" lies in the guidance provided by labeled examples, acting as a supervisor during the learning process. This approach allows the algorithm to generalize and make predictions on new, unseen data by leveraging learned patterns from the labeled training set."

    "**Ans:** In the hospital sector, a common example of supervised learning involves using machine learning algorithms to predict medical conditions based on patient data. For instance, in the case of diabetes prediction, a dataset with labeled patient records (indicating the presence or absence of diabetes) is used to train a supervised learning model. This model learns patterns and relationships between patient features (e.g., age, BMI, blood pressure) and the medical condition. After training, the model is evaluated and, if reliable, applied to new patient data for predicting the likelihood of diabetes. This application aids healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention, contributing to more accurate diagnoses."

    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting:**\n",
    "   - Decision trees can be prone to overfitting, especially when they become too complex. Overfitting occurs when a tree captures noise or specific patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data. This can lead to poor performance on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instability to Small Variations:**\n",
    "   - Decision trees are sensitive to small variations in the training data. A slight change in the data or the addition/removal of a few data points may result in a significantly different tree structure. This instability can make decision trees less robust and more susceptible to variations in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bias Towards Dominant Classes:**\n",
    "   - In scenarios where one class significantly dominates the others in the dataset (class imbalance), decision trees may exhibit a bias towards the dominant class. The algorithm tends to make predictions in favor of the majority class, potentially neglecting the minority class and leading to suboptimal performance for the underrepresented class.\n"

Random Forest is known for its robustness, generalization ability, and efficiency in handling large datasets. It is widely used across various domains and provides insights into feature importance."
