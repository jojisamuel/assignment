They work by propagating probabilities through the graph, allowing for efficient inference and decision-making under uncertainty. BBNs find applications in medical diagnosis, risk assessment, finance, fault diagnosis, natural language processing, and environmental modeling. While they are flexible and powerful, their effectiveness depends on accurate modeling and knowledge elicitation."
